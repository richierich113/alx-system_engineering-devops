# 0x0F-load_balancer
In this project, I configure servers and add a load balancer to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.
