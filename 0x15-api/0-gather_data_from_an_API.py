'''
Write a Python(3.4.3) script that, using
REST API which is (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), for a given
employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.

Requirements:
    -You must use `urllib` or `requests` module
    -The script must accept an integer as a parameter, which is the employee ID
    -The script must display on the standard output the employee TODO list
    progress in this exact format:
        -First line: `Employee EMPLOYEE_NAME is done with tasks\
        (NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS/TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS):`
            -`EMPLOYEE_NAME`: name of the employee
            -`NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS`: number of completed tasks
            -`TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS`: total number of tasks, which is the sum
            of completed and non-completed tasks
        -Second and N next lines display the title of completed tasks:
        `TASK_TITLE` (with 1 tabulation and 1 space before the `TASK_TITLE`)
